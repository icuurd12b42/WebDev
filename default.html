    <p>Stuff I played around with: JavaScript and Canvas stuff.</p>

    <p><a href="https://icuurd12b42.github.io/WebDev/MIDI/default.html" target="_blank">MIDI</a> is a MIDI system, graphical keyboard, has MIDI interface to keyboard, includes a UI system on canvas. This is a JavaScript rehash of something I played with in Game Maker.</p>

    <p><a href="https://icuurd12b42.github.io/WebDev/HexSpace/default.html" target="_blank">HexSpace</a> is basically me asking ChatGPT to code for me. I essentially rewrote a top-down 2D space engine in a few days.</p>

    <p>I want to take a moment to acknowledge that in these projects, I'm utilizing systems that aren't originally mine but are available on the web. I apologize if I didn't explicitly mention them. The collaborative nature of coding often involves building upon existing tools and frameworks, and I appreciate the work of those who created them.</p>

    <p>Additionally, it's worth noting that the system I'm working with replicates an installation on my machine.</p>

    <p>The structure is what I have on my local server. Unfortunatly I cant make it work on github pages.</p>
