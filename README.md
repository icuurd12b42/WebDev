"Stuff I played around with: JavaScript and Canvas stuff.

MIDI is a MIDI system, graphical keyboard, has MIDI interface to keyboard, includes a UI system on canvas. This is a JavaScript rehash of something I played with in Game Maker.

HexSpace is basically me asking ChatGPT to code for me. I essentially rewrote a top-down 2D space engine in a few days.

I want to take a moment to acknowledge that in these projects, I'm utilizing systems that aren't originally mine but are available on the web. I apologize if I didn't explicitly mention them. The collaborative nature of coding often involves building upon existing tools and frameworks, and I appreciate the work of those who created them.

Additionally, it's worth noting that the system I'm working with replicates an installation on my machine."
